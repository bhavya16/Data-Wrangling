# P3-Data-Wrangling-with-MongoDB

This is the 3rd project for the Udacity Data Analyst - Nanodegree. I was tasked at choosing any area of the world from https://www.openstreetmap.org and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data. I chose the DC-Baltimore region.Python was used to clean the data and prepare it for inserting into the NoSQL database: MongoDB. Many queries were then run to arrive at interesting findings.
